# The H0 Hypothesis is that there is no change in the mean of the treated and untreated data.
# the 95 percent confidence interval is between -0.0015656142 and -0.0009451127 with a p-value of 2.182e-15.
# The p-value is not within confidence interval, thus the null hypothesis is rejected for the alternative hypothesis.
# Alternative Hypothesis: there is a difference in mean between the treated and untreated data. ("Tentatively": does this prove that the
# change is provoked by the drug? or is it only a batch effect? Check the boxplots for batch effect identification.
